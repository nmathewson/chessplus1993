This is Chess Plus, a broken build-your-own-pieces chess variant 
that I did in 1992.  I found it on an old floppy and thought it
would be fun to post it to the internet.  It was, I think, made
for MS DOS, with Borland Turbo C++.  Enjoy.


I've fixed no bugs, misspellings, or other stupidities other than
to remove my old address, and a lame joke at an old classmate's expense. 
In particular, please ignore all copyright notices and stern warnings to
